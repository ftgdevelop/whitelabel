  "q1p1": "These days, in the age of the Internet and the online exchange of information, many industries have undergone many changes. One area that never seemed to be able to provide services virtually was tourism and travel; Because the trip was nothing but a physical presence at the destination. In the past, people were content to decide to travel to their intended destination and get there by any means. This traditional method posed many problems for travelers. For example, if they needed to stay in a hotel, they had to go to the hotel in person on the same day, and this alone caused many problems; These include the lack of capacity of the hotel, the dissatisfaction of the traveler with the space of the hotel, the lack of facilities needed by the traveler in that particular hotel and many other issues.",

As for the floor, some hotels have divided their rooms into different floors and have different prices for each of them, from which you can choose the class range you want.",
